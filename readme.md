# Image Processing Library
## Overview
This project is a C-based image processing library that provides various functions to manipulate and analyze images. The library includes functionalities for extracting image areas, reducing colors, applying filters, and performing convolutions. The operations are primarily focused on processing RGBA images.

## Features
- Area Extraction: Extract a specific area from an image.
- Hot Color Diffusion: Diffuse the hot colors in an image.
- Min-Max Value Computation: Compute the minimum and maximum values of an image's channel.
- Color Reduction: Reduce the number of colors in an image to a 216-color palette.
- 2D Filtering: Apply various 2D filters including mean, Gaussian, and Sobel.
- 1D Filtering: Apply 1D convolution for fast Gaussian filtering.
- Image Mirroring: Mirror images horizontally.
